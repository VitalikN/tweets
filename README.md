## Tweets - test-project

[Tweets](https://vitalikn.github.io/tweets) -  small SPA (single page application) project. It presents a simple connection to the [mocapi.io](https://mockapi.io/projects) server to display a list of "fake tweets" users, perform some simple operations, and navigate the page.

- change the number of tweets and read/write them from/to the server;
- adaptive design covers two screen types with the following
breakpoints: 420px, 860px
- navigation between pages
- implement server-based pagination to limit user downloads;
